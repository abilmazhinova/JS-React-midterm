# Midterm Project — React TV Show Search App

This project was created as part of my **Midterm** for the JS React course.

## Description
The application allows users to **search for TV shows and series** using the **TVmaze API** — a free and open API for TV show data.  
Users can type a keyword to find shows, see results as styled cards, and load more if available.  
If no shows are found, a message appears and the search field is cleared automatically after 3 seconds, returning to random recommendations.
