# Midterm Project — React TV Show Search App

This project was created as part of my **Midterm** for the JS React course.

## 📖 Description
The application allows users to **search for TV shows and series** using the **TVmaze API** — a free and open API for TV show data.  
Users can type a keyword to find shows, see results as styled cards, and load more if available.  
If no shows are found, a message appears and the search field is cleared automatically after 3 seconds, returning to random recommendations.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used
- **React.js** — component-based architecture
- **TVmaze API** — public API for TV shows (`https://www.tvmaze.com/api`)
- **CSS Modules** — separate styling for each component
- **Hooks:** `useState`, `useEffect` for state management and side effects
- **Event Handling:** search input, submit, clear, and “Load more” button
